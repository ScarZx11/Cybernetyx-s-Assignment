# Cybernetyx-s-Assignment

This project implements a lightweight FastAPI server for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The server uses ChromaDBâ€™s persistent client for ingesting and querying documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT) and leverages the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Hugging Face for generating embeddings.

1. Dependencies
Before setting up the server, make sure you have the following dependencies installed.

pip install -r requirements.txt


Required Python Libraries:
FastAPI: Web framework for building the API.
ChromaDB: A vector database for document storage and retrieval.
sentence-transformers: For generating embeddings from documents using the Hugging Face model all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
pyngrok: To create a public URL for the FastAPI server (especially useful for exposing the local server during development).
python-docx, PyMuPDF: For document parsing (DOCX, PDF).
Uvicorn: ASGI server for running the FastAPI app.


Example requirements.txt:

fastapi
uvicorn
chromadb
sentence-transformers
pyngrok
python-docx
PyMuPDF


2. Setup and Installation

i. git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-rag-server.git
cd fastapi-rag-server

ii. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

iii. Get your ngrok Authtoken:
If you are using ngrok to expose your FastAPI server publicly, you need to authenticate it with your ngrok account. Follow these steps:

Sign up for an account at ngrok.

After signing up, go to your ngrok dashboard and copy your authtoken.

Run the following command in your terminal to set the authtoken:
ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN

iv. Run the FastAPI Server:
To run the FastAPI server locally:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

v. Expose the server using ngrok:
If you want to access the server publicly, use ngrok to tunnel the localhost:

from pyngrok import ngrok

public_url = ngrok.connect(8000)
print(f"FastAPI public URL: {public_url}")


This will print the public URL, which you can use to interact with the API from anywhere.


3. Configurations

ChromaDB Configuration: The server uses ChromaDB for document storage. It is configured by default to use an in-memory database, but you can modify it to use a persistent database (like SQLite) if needed.

ngrok: Ensure you have the correct authtoken configured as described above to expose your FastAPI server publicly.

a. API Endpoints

i. Ingest Documents

Endpoint: POST /ingest
Description: Ingests documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) into ChromaDB. This endpoint processes the document, generates embeddings, and stores them in the database.

Request Body:
{
  "file": "<file-object>"
}

file: The document file (PDF, DOCX, TXT) to be ingested.


ii. Query Documents
Endpoint: POST /query

Description: Queries the ChromaDB for documents related to a given query. This endpoint uses the sentence-transformers model to generate query embeddings and performs the retrieval from the database.

Request Body:
{
  "query": "What is the capital of France?"
}

query: The text query to search the documents for relevant information.
